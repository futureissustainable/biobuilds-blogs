# BIOBUILDS Market Strategy by Language

This document defines keyword strategies, geographic focus, and content approaches for each market.

---

## DACH Market (DE)

### Geographic Focus
- **Primary:** Germany, Austria
- **Secondary:** EU average (for price context)

### Keywords (Best to Least, All Good Quality)

| Priority | Keyword | Volume | Quality | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Fertighaus** | Highest | High | Main entry point; mainstream German term |
| 2 | **Holzhaus** | High | High | Sustainability angle; timber focus |
| 3 | **Passivhaus** | Medium | High | Premium segment; certification-aware |
| 4 | **Effizienzhaus** | Medium | High | Subsidy-related (KfW tiers) |

### Price Positioning
- German conventional: €2,500-3,000/m²
- German Passivhaus market: €2,700-3,500/m²
- **BIOBUILDS: €2,200/m²** = 10-20% below DACH Passivhaus market

### Content Approach
- Heavy emphasis on **KfW subsidies** (up to €37,500)
- Austrian programs (klimaaktiv, Wohnbauförderung)
- Technical precision, engineering credibility
- Reference German building codes (GEG, Landesbauordnungen)
- Audience is sophisticated, expects data

### Subsidy Focus
- **Germany:** KfW 40, KfW 40 Plus programs
- **Austria:** Regional Wohnbauförderung, klimaaktiv certification bonuses

## Romania Market (RO)

### Geographic Focus
- **Primary:** Romania
- **Secondary:** Germany (aspirational benchmark), EU average

### Keywords (Quality vs Volume Trade-off)

| Priority | Keyword | Volume | Quality | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **casă pasivă** | Lowest | Highest | Best leads; serious buyers |
| 2 | **casă prefabricată** | Medium | Medium | Mainstream term |
| 3 | **casă modulară** | Highest | Lowest | High volume but price-focused leads |

### Price Positioning — ULTRA COMPETITIVE
- Romanian conventional (inefficient): ~€1,900-2,000/m²
- Romanian Passivhaus market: €2,500-3,000/m²
- **BIOBUILDS: €2,200/m²** = only 10-15% more than inefficient, but certified Passivhaus

This is the key Romanian value proposition: Passivhaus certification at near-conventional prices.

### Content Approach
- Educational tone (market is less mature)
- Emphasize German engineering, EU standards
- Address skepticism about prefab quality
- Show Romania vs Germany price comparisons (Romania wins)
- Less subsidy content (fewer programs available)
- Build trust through PHI certification, international standards

### Market Challenges to Address
- Only 3 PHI certifiers in Romania
- Most components imported from DE/AT
- Limited local Passivhaus expertise
- Buyer education needed on certification value

## Europe/International Market (EN)

### Geographic Focus
- **Primary:** EU average (pan-European)
- **Secondary:** Germany (mature market example), Romania (factory location)

### Keywords (Best to Least)

| Priority | Keyword | Volume | Quality | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Passive House** | Lower | Highest | Serious buyers; certification-aware |
| 2 | **prefab homes** | High | Medium | Broad interest; includes tire-kickers |
| 3 | **modular homes** | High | Medium | Often confused with mobile/manufactured |
| 4 | **timber frame homes** | Medium | Good | Sustainability-conscious segment |
| 5 | **energy efficient homes** | High | Lower | Vague intent |
| 6 | **zero energy homes** | Low | High | Regulatory-aware buyers (ZEB) |

### Price Positioning
- EU average conventional: €2,200-2,800/m²
- EU average Passivhaus: €2,800-3,500/m²
- **BIOBUILDS: €2,200/m²** = competitive across all EU markets

### Content Approach
- Data-driven, research-backed
- Heavy focus on EU regulations (EPBD 2024/1275, ZEB mandates 2028/2030)
- Three-market comparisons (DE vs EU avg vs RO)
- International standards (PHI, not country-specific)
- Less subsidy detail (varies too much by country)
- Position as pan-European solution

### Regulatory Content Focus
- EPBD recast (2024/1275)
- Zero-Emission Building (ZEB) mandates: public buildings 2028, all new buildings 2030
- MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standards)
- Fossil fuel phase-out timeline (2040)
