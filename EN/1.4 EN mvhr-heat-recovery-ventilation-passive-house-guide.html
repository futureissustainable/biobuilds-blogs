<div class="bb-body">
<p>Every Passive House relies on one piece of technology more than any other: the mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery. While superinsulation, triple glazing, and airtight construction create the building envelope that retains heat, MVHR is what makes airtight buildings livable. It provides the continuous fresh air occupants need while recovering up to 95% of the heat that would otherwise escape through ventilation—solving the fundamental tension between energy efficiency and indoor air quality.</p>

<p>For homeowners considering Passive House construction in Germany, Austria, or Romania, understanding MVHR is essential. The system accounts for a significant portion of the Passivhaus premium, determines long-term running costs, and directly impacts daily living quality. This guide covers everything you need to know: how the technology works, what it costs, how to maintain it, and why it delivers measurably better air quality than opening windows ever could.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mvhr">What is MVHR and why Passive Houses require it</h2>

<p>MVHR stands for Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery—a system that continuously extracts stale air from wet rooms (kitchens, bathrooms) while simultaneously supplying fresh filtered air to living spaces and bedrooms. The key innovation is a heat exchanger that transfers warmth from the outgoing air to the incoming air, recovering energy that would otherwise be lost.</p>

<p>In conventional buildings, ventilation happens through a combination of window opening, trickle vents, and air leakage through gaps in the building fabric. This uncontrolled approach creates significant heat loss—according to research, approximately <span class="bb-stat-inline">33% of heat losses</span> in multi-family buildings occur through ventilation. Passive Houses eliminate this waste by making the building envelope airtight and replacing uncontrolled ventilation with a precisely engineered MVHR system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A ventilation unit with heat recovery is absolutely essential for meeting the requirements for a healthy indoor climate while allowing for significant energy savings. The Passive House standard proves that comfort and efficiency are not competing objectives.</p>
<cite>Passipedia, Passive House Institute</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>The Passive House requirement for airtightness—no more than 0.6 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure—means that without MVHR, a certified building would have inadequate ventilation. Carbon dioxide would accumulate, humidity would rise, and indoor air quality would deteriorate rapidly. MVHR solves this by providing controlled, filtered ventilation at rates between 0.25 and 0.4 air changes per hour, maintaining excellent air quality while recovering the vast majority of heat from exhaust air.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How heat recovery ventilation works</h2>

<p>An MVHR system consists of four main components: supply air ducts, extract air ducts, a central unit containing the heat exchanger and fans, and filters. The system operates continuously, typically at a low background rate that increases automatically based on humidity sensors or manual boost controls.</p>

<h3>The airflow path</h3>

<p>Fresh outdoor air enters through an intake, passes through a filter (typically F7 grade for fine particle filtration), and flows through the heat exchanger. Simultaneously, stale air is extracted from kitchens and bathrooms, passes through a separate filter, and flows through the opposite side of the heat exchanger. The two airstreams never mix—they pass on opposite sides of thin plates that transfer heat from the warm exhaust to the cold incoming air.</p>

<div class="bb-stat-cell-number">0.35</div>
<div class="bb-stat-cell-label">Wh/m³ specific fan power in efficient units</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the Passive House Institute's test conditions (outdoor temperature of -10°C), a certified unit with 91% efficiency warms incoming air to at least 16.5°C before it enters living spaces. This means the fresh air arriving in bedrooms and living rooms is already comfortable—no cold draughts, no need for additional heating at the point of delivery.</p>

<h3>Heat exchanger types</h3>

<p>Most residential MVHR units use counterflow plate heat exchangers, where air passes in opposite directions on alternating plates. This design achieves the highest efficiency—up to 95% in laboratory conditions. Cross-flow exchangers are simpler and cheaper but typically achieve only 50-70% efficiency. Rotary heat exchangers (thermal wheels) can achieve high efficiency but risk some air mixing between supply and extract streams, making them less common in residential applications.</p>

<p>Some systems include <strong>enthalpy recovery</strong> (also called energy recovery ventilation or ERV), which transfers both heat and moisture. This can help maintain humidity levels in winter when incoming cold air is naturally very dry. However, standard heat-only recovery is more common in European Passive Houses, where humidity management is typically adequate with basic controls.</p>

<h2 id="efficiency-requirements">Efficiency requirements and certification</h2>

<p>The Passive House Standard requires that MVHR units achieve at least <span class="bb-stat-inline">75% heat recovery efficiency</span> when installed and operating. Many Passivhaus-certified units exceed 90%, with the best achieving 94-95% under test conditions. This efficiency, combined with low electrical consumption (specific fan power of 0.45 Wh/m³ or less), means MVHR saves far more energy than it consumes.</p>

<h3>The certification advantage</h3>

<p>Using a Passivhaus-certified MVHR unit provides verification that the system will perform as specified. Critically, if a non-certified unit is used, the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) applies a <span class="bb-stat-inline">12% penalty</span> to the manufacturer's stated efficiency. A unit claiming 93% efficiency would only count as 81% in energy calculations—potentially pushing the building over the heating demand limit.</p>

<!-- Single Stat -->
<div class="bb-stat">
<div class="bb-stat-number">COP 15</div>
<div class="bb-stat-label">Coefficient of Performance achievable by an 80% efficient MVHR with 0.35 Wh/m³ fan power</div>
<div class="bb-stat-source">Based on heat recovered versus electrical energy consumed at typical operating conditions</div>
</div>

<p>The coefficient of performance (COP) illustrates why MVHR is so effective. A Passivhaus-certified unit with 80% efficiency and 0.35 Wh/m³ specific fan power achieves a COP of approximately 15—meaning it saves 15 kWh of heat energy for every 1 kWh of electricity consumed. This compares favourably to even the best heat pumps (COP 3-5) and dramatically outperforms direct electric heating (COP 1).</p>

<h3>System sizing</h3>

<p>MVHR systems are sized based on airflow requirements, which depend on the number of occupants and room volumes. The Passive House approach typically specifies air changes between 0.3 and 0.4 per hour—lower than many building codes require, but adequate for excellent air quality because the air is continuously exchanged rather than replaced in bursts. For a 150m² home with standard ceiling heights, this translates to airflow rates of approximately 100-150 m³/hour.</p>

<p>Critically, the system must be designed so that supply air volumes match extract air volumes, creating a balanced system with neither positive nor negative pressure in the building. Imbalanced systems can draw unconditioned air through any remaining leakage points, reducing both efficiency and comfort.</p>

<h2 id="air-quality">Indoor air quality benefits</h2>

<p>MVHR delivers measurably superior air quality compared to natural ventilation. Research comparing mechanically ventilated homes to naturally ventilated equivalents shows consistent improvements across multiple parameters: lower CO2 concentrations, reduced particulates, more stable humidity, and fewer temperature fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Carbon dioxide levels</h3>

<p>A comprehensive study found that peak CO2 concentrations in naturally ventilated spaces exceeded 4,500 ppm, while mechanical ventilation kept levels below 1,500 ppm—a <span class="bb-stat-inline">62% reduction</span> in average concentrations. Another study across residential apartments found CO2 reaching 3,300 ppm with natural ventilation compared to much lower levels with MVHR.</p>

<p>The Pettenkofer limit of 1,000 ppm is widely considered the threshold for good air quality. Without mechanical ventilation, a two-person bedroom can exceed this limit within the first hour of sleep, potentially reaching 8,000 ppm by morning with doors closed. MVHR maintains CO2 below comfortable thresholds throughout the night.</p>

<!-- Key Takeaway -->
<div class="bb-takeaway">
<div class="bb-takeaway-label">Key Takeaway</div>
<p>Studies show 74% of Passive House dwellings with MVHR never measured CO2 above 1,400 ppm, compared to frequent exceedances in naturally ventilated homes. Chinese research measured 622-841 ppm in passive houses versus over 1,000 ppm in conventional apartments—a direct result of continuous mechanical ventilation.</p>
</div>

<h3>Particulate matter and filtration</h3>

<p>MVHR systems filter incoming air, typically using F7-grade filters that capture particles down to 0.4 micrometres—including most pollen, dust, and fine particulates. Research documented PM2.5 levels inside a Passive House at approximately half those of a conventional house on the same street, demonstrating effective outdoor pollution reduction.</p>

<p>However, studies also show that filtration effectiveness depends on system design and filter maintenance. One study found PM2.5 infiltration actually increased after retrofitting mechanical ventilation, because higher airflow rates brought more particles despite filtration. This highlights the importance of using appropriate filter grades and maintaining them regularly—topics covered in the maintenance section below.</p>

<h3>Humidity control</h3>

<p>MVHR systems help maintain optimal indoor humidity between 30-60% relative humidity—the range associated with minimal pathogen growth, comfortable airways, and healthy skin. UK studies showed 75% of MVHR-equipped homes met target humidity levels below 7 g/kg absolute humidity, with bathroom moisture clearing within 3 hours of shower use.</p>

<p>One caveat: post-renovation studies showed relative humidity dropping from 53% to 28% with mechanical ventilation—below comfortable levels, particularly in winter. This occurs because cold outdoor air, even when heated, has low absolute humidity. Some occupants in Passive Houses report dry air in winter bedrooms, which can be addressed through enthalpy recovery units, standalone humidifiers, or simply drying laundry indoors.</p>

<h3>Health outcomes</h3>

<p>Research comparing mechanically ventilated energy-efficient homes to conventional homes found that inhabitants rated indoor air quality significantly higher, and associations were observed between lower CO2 levels and reduced perception of stale air. Further studies linked improved indoor air quality parameters to reduced daily risk of eye fatigue, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="costs">Installation and running costs</h2>

<p>MVHR represents a significant component of Passive House construction costs, but one that delivers ongoing savings through reduced heating bills. Understanding both upfront and lifecycle costs helps evaluate the investment correctly.</p>

<h3>Installation costs</h3>

<p>Total installed costs for residential MVHR systems in Europe typically range from €4,000 to €9,000, depending on property size, system specifications, and whether the installation is in new construction or retrofit.</p>

</div>

<p>Cost components include the MVHR unit itself (€1,500-€4,000), ductwork and fittings (€1,000-€2,500), system design (€400-€600), installation labour (€1,500-€3,500), and commissioning to verify correct airflows (€300-€500). In new construction where duct routes are planned from the start, installation is straightforward. Retrofit projects face higher costs due to the challenge of routing rigid or semi-rigid ducts through existing structures.</p>

<h3>Annual running costs</h3>

<p>MVHR systems consume remarkably little electricity—typically around <span class="bb-stat-inline">300 kWh per year</span> for continuous operation in a standard home. At current European electricity prices (approximately €0.35-0.50/kWh depending on country), this translates to €105-€150 annually for electricity alone.</p>

<p>Adding filter replacements (€50-€150 per year) and periodic professional servicing (€100-€150 amortised annually), total running costs reach approximately <span class="bb-stat-inline">€200-€350 per year</span>.</p>

<h3>Energy savings and payback</h3>

<p>Against these costs, MVHR delivers substantial heating savings. European Union research found that due to heat recovery by ventilation units, 17 TWh of final energy was saved on space heating in 2020, with projections rising to 40 TWh by 2030. At the household level, systems can reduce heating bills by 25-50%, with documented savings of €400-€500 annually.</p>

<!-- Single Stat -->
<div class="bb-stat">
<div class="bb-stat-number">8-12 years</div>
<div class="bb-stat-label">Typical payback period for MVHR investment through heating cost savings</div>
<div class="bb-stat-source">Based on €400-€500 annual savings against €4,000-€6,000 net installation cost</div>
</div>

<p>A conservative payback calculation: €5,500 installation cost minus €1,500 value of improved air quality (valued at equivalent to air purifiers) equals €4,000 net cost. At €450 annual heating savings minus €100 net running costs, the payback period is approximately 11-12 years. With rising energy prices, this period shortens further.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance requirements</h2>

<p>MVHR maintenance is straightforward but essential. Neglected systems suffer reduced airflow, lower efficiency, increased noise, and potentially degraded air quality. The good news: maintenance is simple enough for most homeowners to perform themselves, with occasional professional servicing.</p>

<h3>Filter replacement</h3>

<p>Filters require replacement every 6-12 months, depending on local air quality and system usage. Urban locations with higher particulate levels may need more frequent changes. Replacement is typically a 10-minute task: open the unit access panel, slide out the old filters, insert new ones.</p>

<p>Filter costs range from €20-€120 per set depending on brand and filter grade. Using genuine manufacturer filters or equivalent-quality alternatives is important—low-quality filters may not achieve the rated filtration efficiency and can increase pressure drop, forcing fans to work harder and consume more electricity.</p>

<h3>Regular cleaning</h3>

<p>Every 6-12 months, inspect and clean:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supply and extract grilles</strong> in rooms—wipe or vacuum to remove dust accumulation</li>
<li><strong>Condensate drain</strong>—ensure it flows freely and isn't blocked</li>
<li><strong>Intake and exhaust terminals</strong> on the building exterior—remove debris, leaves, or insect nests</li>
</ul>

<p>Every 2-3 years, more thorough cleaning is recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heat exchanger</strong>—can be removed and rinsed in warm water (check manufacturer instructions)</li>
<li><strong>Fans</strong>—clean blades to maintain balance and efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Ducts</strong>—professional inspection and cleaning if airflow has decreased significantly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional servicing</h3>

<p>Professional servicing every 2-5 years includes inspection, deep cleaning, system balancing, and verification that airflows match design specifications. Costs typically range from €300-€500. Some installers offer annual service contracts at €200-€300 per year including filter supply—potentially good value for homeowners who prefer not to self-maintain.</p>

<!-- Key Takeaway -->
<div class="bb-takeaway">
<div class="bb-takeaway-label">Maintenance Schedule</div>
<p>Monthly: Check unit is running, no unusual noises. Every 6-12 months: Replace filters, clean grilles. Every 2-3 years: Deep clean heat exchanger and fans. Every 5 years: Professional service and rebalancing. Following this schedule keeps systems running at design efficiency for 15-25 years.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="common-concerns">Common concerns addressed</h2>

<p>Prospective Passive House owners often have questions about MVHR that reflect unfamiliarity with the technology. Here are the most common concerns and evidence-based responses.</p>

<h3>Can I open windows?</h3>

<p>Yes, absolutely. Windows in Passive Houses are fully openable—there's no restriction. However, during heating season, opening windows bypasses the heat recovery system and increases energy consumption. The MVHR provides continuous fresh air without this penalty, so window opening becomes a choice based on preference (warm summer evenings, for example) rather than necessity for ventilation.</p>

<p>Many Passive House occupants report rarely opening windows once they experience the consistent air quality MVHR provides. The air always feels fresh because it is continuously exchanged, unlike conventional homes where air quality degrades between window openings.</p>

<h3>Is the system noisy?</h3>

<p>Properly designed and installed MVHR is barely audible. The unit itself typically produces 25-35 dB at normal operating speeds—equivalent to a whisper or quiet library. Key factors affecting noise include unit location (utility rooms or cupboards away from bedrooms), duct sizing (oversized ducts reduce air velocity and noise), and silencers fitted to duct runs near living spaces.</p>

<p>Poor installations can be noisy. Common causes include undersized ducts creating air turbulence, incorrectly tensioned fan mounts transmitting vibration, or units located in ceiling voids above bedrooms. These issues are design and installation quality problems, not inherent to the technology.</p>

<h3>What about summer overheating?</h3>

<p>Standard MVHR provides modest summer cooling by bringing in cooler night air—the same heat exchanger that retains warmth in winter can be bypassed in summer to allow direct outdoor air intake. Some systems include summer bypass functions that automatically switch based on indoor and outdoor temperatures.</p>

<p>For locations with significant cooling demands, MVHR can be combined with active cooling: chilled water coils in the supply duct, or integration with a reversible heat pump. This adds cost but delivers air conditioning through the same duct system. In Central European climates, well-designed Passive Houses with adequate shading often don't require active cooling—the combination of superinsulation, thermal mass, and night ventilation maintains comfort through typical summer peaks.</p>

<h3>What happens during power cuts?</h3>

<p>When power is lost, MVHR stops. For short outages (a few hours), this isn't a concern—the airtight building retains good air quality much longer than a leaky conventional home would. For extended outages, opening windows provides ventilation as in any building.</p>

<p>Some systems include battery backup options for critical applications. For residential use, this is rarely necessary given the infrequency and duration of typical power outages in developed European countries.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-system">Choosing the right MVHR system</h2>

<p>Selecting an MVHR system involves balancing efficiency, noise levels, features, and budget. Here are the key considerations for Passive House applications.</p>

<h3>Passivhaus certification</h3>

<p>For Passive House projects, using a Passivhaus-certified unit is strongly recommended. The <a href="https://database.passivehouse.com/en/components/">Passive House Component Database</a> lists all certified ventilation units with their tested performance data. Certified units have verified efficiency under standardised conditions, avoiding the 12% PHPP penalty and ensuring the building meets certification requirements.</p>

<h3>Efficiency ratings</h3>

<p>Look for heat recovery efficiency of 85% or higher. Top units achieve 93-95% under test conditions. Remember that real-world efficiency may be slightly lower due to installation factors, but a well-designed system should achieve close to rated performance.</p>

<p>Specific fan power (SFP) indicates electrical efficiency. Passivhaus requires 0.45 Wh/m³ or less; better units achieve 0.35 Wh/m³ or below. Lower SFP means lower running costs and better overall COP.</p>

<h3>Noise ratings</h3>

<p>Check both unit noise (measured in decibels at distance) and outlet noise (noise at supply grilles). Quality units specify noise levels at different fan speeds. For bedroom supply grilles, aim for 25 dB or less at normal operating speed.</p>

<h3>Features to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Humidity sensors</strong>—automatically increase ventilation when humidity rises (useful for kitchens and bathrooms)</li>
<li><strong>CO2 sensors</strong>—adjust ventilation based on occupancy for energy optimisation</li>
<li><strong>Summer bypass</strong>—automatically bypasses heat exchanger when outdoor air is cooler than indoor</li>
<li><strong>Frost protection</strong>—prevents heat exchanger icing in cold climates (essential for continental European locations)</li>
<li><strong>Filter change indicators</strong>—remind occupants when replacement is due</li>
<li><strong>Smart controls</strong>—app-based monitoring and adjustment, integration with home automation</li>
</ul>

<h3>BIOBUILDS system integration</h3>

<p>BIOBUILDS homes come with pre-designed MVHR installations using Passivhaus-certified components. Our partnership with <a href="https://www.zehndergroup.com/">Zehnder Group</a>—one of Europe's leading MVHR manufacturers—ensures systems are correctly sized, efficiently routed, and professionally commissioned. The modular factory production allows ductwork to be partially installed during manufacturing, reducing on-site installation time and ensuring consistent quality.</p>

<hr>

<p>MVHR transforms what could be the weakness of Passive House construction—extreme airtightness—into a strength. Instead of stale air trapped in an efficient envelope, occupants experience consistently fresh, filtered, temperature-stable air at a fraction of the energy cost of conventional ventilation. The technology is proven over three decades across tens of thousands of Passive House buildings, from single-family homes to large apartment complexes and commercial buildings.</p>

<p>For homeowners planning Passive House construction, MVHR is not optional equipment but a fundamental system that enables everything the standard promises: radical energy efficiency combined with exceptional indoor environment quality. Understanding how it works, what it costs, and how to maintain it ensures you can make informed decisions and enjoy the full benefits of your high-performance home.</p>

<div class="bb-faq-answer">
<p>The Passive House Standard requires installed MVHR units to achieve at least 75% heat recovery efficiency. Many Passivhaus-certified units exceed 90% efficiency, with the best reaching 94-95%. If a non-certified unit is used, a 12% penalty is applied to the stated efficiency in PHPP calculations—so a unit rated at 93% would only count as 81% in the energy model.</p>

</button>
<div class="bb-faq-answer">
<p>MVHR installation costs typically range from €4,000-€9,000 for residential properties, depending on home size and system specifications. For a standard 3-4 bedroom home, expect €5,000-€8,000 including the unit, ductwork, design, and commissioning. Retrofit installations cost 20-40% more due to the complexity of routing ducts through existing structures. Passivhaus-certified systems with higher efficiency ratings add €1,000-€2,000 to the cost.</p>

<span>What are the running costs for an MVHR system?</span>
<svg class="bb-faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5">

</button>
<div class="bb-faq-answer">
<p>Annual running costs are approximately €150-€200 for electricity (about 300 kWh per year at typical European rates) plus €50-€150 for filter replacements every 6-12 months. Professional servicing every 2-5 years costs €300-€500, averaging €60-€100 annually. However, heat recovery typically reduces heating bills by 25-50%, saving €400-€500 per year—meaning the net cost is often negative, with the system paying back its installation cost in 8-12 years.</p>

<span>How does MVHR improve indoor air quality compared to natural ventilation?</span>
<svg class="bb-faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5">

</button>
<div class="bb-faq-answer">
<p>Research shows MVHR systems reduce CO2 concentrations by up to 62% compared to natural ventilation—keeping levels below 1,500 ppm versus peaks above 4,500 ppm with window ventilation alone. Studies found 74% of Passive House dwellings with MVHR never measured CO2 above 1,400 ppm. MVHR also filters incoming air (typically F7 grade filters), reducing PM2.5 particulates by approximately 50%, filtering pollen, and reducing outdoor pollutants while maintaining stable humidity between 30-60%.</p>

<span>Can I open windows in a Passive House with MVHR?</span>
<svg class="bb-faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5">
<line x1="12" y1="5" x2="12" y2="19"></line>
<line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line>
</svg>
</button>
<div class="bb-faq-answer">
<p>Yes, you can open windows whenever you wish—there are no restrictions. However, during heating season, opening windows bypasses the heat recovery system and increases energy consumption. The MVHR provides continuous fresh air without this penalty, so window opening becomes a choice for preference (warm summer evenings, for example) rather than a necessity for ventilation. Many Passive House occupants find they rarely need to open windows once they experience the consistent air quality that MVHR provides.</p>
